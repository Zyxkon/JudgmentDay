# JudgmentDay
A zombie apocalypse plugin for Minecraft.
I really don't intend on updating this since I only made this to make an apocalypse map in Minecraft much more immersive. This plugin adds in a scoreboard, thirst system, injuries including broken bones, bleeding and being infected along with some other miscellaneous, unrelated commands and also a command system. There may still be some gitches and the code isn't really optimized, if you stumble upon this you can let me know.
